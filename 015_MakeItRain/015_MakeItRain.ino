   #015 - Make It Rain

   Start Rain from one Blink
   Have them all fall the same direction
   A nice abstractable solution for orientation of faces

   The Blink needs to say which way the rain is falling
   then let the neighboring Blink interpret based on the
   face that is sending and the face that is receiving
